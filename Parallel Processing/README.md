## Project 2
The dataset consists of water bottle images that have been classified based on the level of water inside the bottle. There are three categories of images: Full water level, Half water level, and Overflowing. Each category contains several images of water bottles with the corresponding water level. The purpose of the dataset is to be used for an image classification problem, where a machine learning model is trained to classify the water level of a given water bottle image.
