## Project 1
Implemented and compared parallel versions of Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort algorithms using Python's threading module. The project demonstrates how parallel computing can optimize sorting operations and improve performance over traditional sequential methods.

## Project 2
The dataset consists of water bottle images that have been classified based on the level of water inside the bottle. There are three categories of images: Full water level, Half water level, and Overflowing. Each category contains several images of water bottles with the corresponding water level. The purpose of the dataset is to be used for an image classification problem, where a machine learning model is trained to classify the water level of a given water bottle image.

The main objective of this project is to create and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for a multi-class image classification task. on a dataset of water bottle images, with each image labelled as Full water level, Half water level, or Overflowing. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify a given water bottle image based on its water level.
